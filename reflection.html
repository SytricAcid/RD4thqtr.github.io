    <h1>Reflection 4th Quarter</h1>
    <p>
        The third and fourth quarters felt like trekking through unpredictable terrain—some paths were smooth, while others were filled with obstacles. The workload piled up fast, with performance tasks and deadlines stacking on top of each other, making Science and Math especially challenging. There were moments when everything felt overwhelming, but I kept moving forward, knowing that perseverance was key. <br> <br>

One of the more memorable experiences was the English Theatre Play, where I was part of the props committee. Contributing to the behind-the-scenes work and seeing the final performance come together was a rewarding experience. On the other hand, VPOP was a mess—our class struggled with organization, and we didn’t place, but it was a learning experience in teamwork and preparation. <br> <br>

Looking back, these quarters tested my patience and resilience, but they also taught me that growth comes from pushing through challenges. Though the journey was tough, I know every struggle helped shape me into a stronger, more determined student. <br>
